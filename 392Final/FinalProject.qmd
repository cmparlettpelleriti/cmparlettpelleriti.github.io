### Part #1 (Optional; Do Not Need to Turn In)
Find a data set that's interesting to you. Make sure it has at least 7 variables and at least 100 rows, and at least 4 continuous/interval columns. But the more the better. You may **NOT** use any of the datasets we've used in class (see [here for reference](https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/tree/master/Data)).

Some places to find data:

### Part 2
::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Part #2 (Individual)
(**10 points**; PDF) Pretend you're a company who is interested in the dataset you chose. Come up with at **least 7 questions** that you want to answer based on the variables (at the top of this document, **provide a short description of each of the variables in the model**). Use [THIS FORMAT](https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/blob/master/FinalProject/Example%20of%20Questions%20Format.pdf).


These questions can be about the relationships between variables, or how well one thing can predict another, clustering...etc, but note that in your final project you must use at least:


-  **1 supervised learning model** (includes both regression and classification models)
- **1 clustering/reccomendation model** (DBSCAN, HAC, K-Means, Gaussian Mixtures, or NearestNeighbors), and
- **1 instance of dimensionality reduction** (PCA or LASSO)

so keep that in mind when creating questions. You can use more than one of these for a single question (e.g. using PCA and then doing linear regression on the components).

You will be graded on the quality of the questions. Questions should be interesting and complex (e.g. questions like "is this model more than 90% accurate?" should be expanded to something like "is this model accurate as measured by accuracy, examination of patterns in the confusion matrix and/or consistent accuracy across gender/race/income/education groups?"). Questions related to the same model/analysis should be included as 1 question (for example, if you build a model predicting cat weight from cat height, cat age, and cat diet, the question should be somthing like "which variables have the strongest impact on cat weight?" instead of having three separate questions "what is the impact of cat height on cat weight?", "what is the impact of cat age on cat weight?", and ""what is the impact of cat diet on cat weight?")

### Part #2 (Group)

📣 EACH GROUP MEMBER SHOULD TURN IN A COPY OF THIS


(**10 points**; PDF) Pretend you're a company who is interested in the dataset you chose. Come up with at **5 questions per person** that you want to answer based on the variables (at the top of this document, **provide a short description of each of the variables in the model**). Use [THIS FORMAT](https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/blob/master/FinalProject/Example%20of%20Questions%20Format.pdf).

### Part 3
PLEASE NOTE THAT LATE DAYS CANNOT BE USED DURING FINALS WEEK *OR* WHEN THEY PREVENT YOUR PEERS FROM DOING PEER REVIEW ON TIME.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Part #3 (Individual)

(**27 points**; PDF) Now put on your data scientist hat. Write an **ORGANIZED analysis plan** to answer **3** of the questions you came up with. Think about which of the questions need a predictive model, which need a clustering model, which need dimensionality reduction, and which maybe need just visualizations/summaries. (at the top of this document, **provide a short description of each of the variables in the model**)

YOU MUST USE at least:


- 1 supervised learning model
- 1 clustering/reccomendation model (DBSCAN, HAC, K-Means, Gaussian Mixtures, or NearestNeighbors), and
- 1 instance of dimensionality reduction *(two or more of these could be used to answer the same question)*. Dimensionality reduction includes LASSO and PCA.

Each Question needs TWO ggplots to go with it. Please read the instructions for section **5** so you know what your analysis will need to include.

Write up this plan as if you're submitting it to a company to tell them what you're planning to do. CLEARLY mark where each part is and answer each part separately using [THIS FORMAT](https://github.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/blob/master/FinalProject/Example%20of%20Analysis%20Plan%20Format.pdf).

### Part 4

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
### Part #4 (Individual and Group)
Peer review + write a critique of two person/group's plan (~ 1 page, double spaced). You should answer:


 - what does this plan do well?
 - what could be improved (give specifics) and why?
 - what are some (perhaps unavoidable) limitations of the data/analysis plan?

### Part 5
PLEASE NOTE THAT LATE DAYS CANNOT BE USED DURING FINALS WEEK *OR* WHEN THEY PREVENT YOUR PEERS FROM DOING PEER REVIEW ON TIME.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

### Part #5 (Individual)
(**38 points**;  PDF + PDF of Jupyter Notebook) **Perform the planned analyses for your 3 questions** , **make the graphs in a python notebook**, and write a **technical report using Quarto**. For each of your 3 questions make sure you have:


- a) <b> the analysis code (py or ipynb)</b>
- b) <b> a well labeled PDF report with explicit answer to the question with detailed responses of how you came to this answer and the answer's importance.</b> This should be targeted at an audience that are NOT familiar with Data Science (e.g. pretend you're presenting these results to shareholders/your boss).
- c) <b>the PDF report should also have two ggplot data visualizations + captions</b> (graphs will be graded on how efficient and clear they are, so make sure you make good aesthetic choices that help emphasize your message).

(be sure to note in the report if there were any changes to your analysis plan since part #3 and **why**)


Answers should be clear, concise, and complete. You will be graded on your code, the clarity of your responses, and the correctness of your methods. Save that notebook as a PDF. You must clearly label each question and the analyses that apply to it using Markdown.Don't forget to turn in a README with this part.

### Part 6

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
### Part #6 (Individual and Group)

📣 PEOPLE IN GROUPS SHOULD EACH MAKE A SEPARATE VIDEO, YOU CAN SPLIT UP YOUR QUESTIONS/INFO HOWEVER YOU WANT BETWEEN GROUP MEMBERS.

📣 GROUP MEMBERS SHOULD EACH MAKE THEIR OWN VIDEO/PRESENTATION (each 5-9 minutes).

(**8 points**; Video link) **Prepare a short presentation of the results** (powerpoint, prezi, keynote...etc, DO NOT just scroll through your notebook.). Make a short (5-9 minute, not under or over) **video presentation** explaining what you found. Upload it to youtube or similar site (you can put your video as Unlisted if you don't want anyone else to see)


I recommend OBS Streamlabs or Zoom if you want to record your screen (with the presentation/data) and yourself presenting at one time. Or get someone to film you presenting it on a screen (or if needed print our your slides and hold them up!). Or if you're on a Mac you can use QuickTime to record your screen while you present.

You may alternatively opt to **present in person** during the final time, in which case you will watch the presentations of the other in-person presenters instead of being put in a group. Your in-person presentation should be 3-5 minutes per person (in other words, a group of 3 should not have a presentation shorter than 9 minutes or longer than 15, a group of 2 should not have a presentation shorter than 6 minutes or longer than 10, individuals can have a presentation between 3-7 minutes).

## Checklists 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Individual Checklist
To review, throughout the project you'll need to submit:

1. the **name/a link to the data set** you're planning to use (you don't have to do this, but it saves you time/effort, in case your dataset won't work out)
2. A **PDF or text submission** with your questions.
3. A **PDF** with your analysis plan.
4. A **text submission or PDF** on Canvas with your critique of *another* students plan.
5. A **py/ipynb** of your python code and a **PDF Report**. Please get rid of extra analyses/code that you did not end up using. You must clearly indicate where each question is being answered. Also include a **README**.
6. A **link** to a short video presentation (do not send the video directly). 
7. A **Feedback Form** given to you by Dr. Parlett.

### Group Checklist
## Group Option
Groups are optional (you may work alone) but if you choose to work in a group, READ THE MODIFICATIONS below, and know that working in a group is agreeing to 1) follow these modifications and 2) be graded together with your group members (you will not receive separate grades except for completing the peer review).

If you'd like to work in a group (up to 3) then:

- You must tell me your group members and their sections by via SLACK or Email before your Questions (Part I #2) are due.
- (🧑‍🤝‍🧑 *Together; Each submit a copy*) For Part I, #2 You need to come up with 5 questions **per member** and **EACH** of you must submit a copy of the same PDF to canvas.
- (🧑‍🤝‍🧑 *Together; Each submit a copy*)For Part I, #3 You should come up with the plan together and EACH submit a copy of the same plan. You need to answer 2 questions **per member** (so a group of 2 would need to answer 4 questions, a group of 3 would need to answer 6).
- (*Separate*) For Part I, #4 You should write your critiques separately.
- (🧑‍🤝‍🧑 *Together; Each submit a copy*) For Part II, #5 You should work on it together. Again, you need to answer 2 questions **per member** (so a group of 2 would need to answer 4 questions, a group of 3 would need to answer 6). You must ALSO submit a joined statement (as a PDF) describing what each member did. Each of you should submit a copy of this.
- (*Separate*) For Part II, #6 You each need to make your OWN video presenting on 2 of the questions each, however you can collaborate on the presentation materials (the slides..etc). Each of you should submit a separate video.
- (*Separate*) For Part II #7 You need to each do separate peer reviews.


## Group Option Checklist
To review, throughout the project you'll need to submit:

1. the **name/a link to the data set** you're planning to use (you don't have to do this, but it saves you time/effort, in case your dataset won't work out), and **the names and section #s of who is in your group** (you do need to do this)
2. A **PDF or text submission** with your questions (EACH group member must submit a copy of the SAME document).
3. A **PDF** with your analysis plan (EACH group member must submit a copy of the SAME document).
4. A **text submission or PDF** on Canvas with your critique of *another* students plan (EACH group member will review a separate students/group).
5. A **py/ipynb** of your python notebooks and a **PDF Report**. Please get rid of extra analyses/code that you did not end up using. You must clearly indicate where each question is being answered using Titles in Markdown. Also include a **README**, and **joint statement of who did what** (EACH group member must submit a copy of the SAME documents).
6. A **link** to a short video presentation (do not send the video directly). Each group member does their own video.
7. A **Feedback Form** given to you by Dr. Parlett. Each group member will review separate students/groups.
