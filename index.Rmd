I am an avid lover of anything silly or statistical (especially if it's both at once). I earned a PhD in Computational and Data Science in 2021, and currently teach full time as well as do research and statistical consulting. My main courses include R, Intro to Programming (in Python), and Data Science.

My goal in life is to empower people to be able to do their own statistical analyses, through consulting, education, and the occasional stats meme on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett).

I also do a lot of statistical writing, both professionally and for fun. Check out the Writing page to see some of my work. If you're in the mood for something silly, check out [Everyone P-hacks](https://medium.com/@chelseaparlett/everyone-p-hacks-a-lighthearted-guide-for-new-academics-55f68c9f78cb) or [An Ode to Neural Networks and Their Layers](https://medium.com/@chelseaparlett/one-layer-two-layer-1a2c70e594).For somehting more serious, I recommend checking out the [Crash Course Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr) videos I wrote, or this article on [Hierarchical clustering](https://community.jmp.com/t5/JMP-Blog/Hierarchical-clustering/ba-p/192425) I wrote for JMP Software. If you're interested in hiring me, I'd love to write for you! You can contact me [here](contact.html).

When I'm not writing, I'm often technical reviewing! I've tech reviewed books like [Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way](https://nostarch.com/learnbayes) and [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) If you want to hire me as a technical reviewer for your stats/programming/ML related book, contact me [here](contact.html).
